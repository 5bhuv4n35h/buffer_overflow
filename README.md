## types


### stack based


A technically inclined user may exploit stack-based buffer overflows to manipulate the program to their advantage in one of several ways:

- By overwriting a local variable that is located near the vulnerable buffer on the stack, in order to change the behavior of the program
- By overwriting the return address in a [stack frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_frame). Once the function returns, execution will resume at the return address as specified by the attacker - usually a user-input filled buffer
- By overwriting a function pointer[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow#cite_note-1) or [exception handler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handler), which is subsequently executed
- By overwriting a local variable (or pointer) of a different stack frame, which will be used by the function which owns that frame later

### heap based

A buffer overflow occurring in the heap data area is referred to as a heap overflow and is exploitable in a manner different from that of stack-based overflows. Memory on the heap is dynamically allocated by the application at run-time and typically contains program data. Exploitation is performed by corrupting this data in specific ways to cause the application to overwrite internal structures such as linked list pointers. The canonical heap overflow technique overwrites dynamic memory allocation linkage (such as [malloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malloc) meta data) and uses the resulting pointer exchange to overwrite a program function pointer

## exploitation

### windows buffer overflow

#### discovering vulnerablity 


we discover a application is vulnerable to buffer overflow  by fuzzing the application with a fuzzer

### introduction to immunity debuuger

#### adding the application to  imunnity debugger

####  

#### fuzzing the application 

a fuzzer  fuzzes the application with in an random incremental order such that the application stops when it detects a crash or timeout from the application we interact

refer boofuzz

#### replicating the crash 

we replicate crash by sending the appliation with value at which it crashed 

#### controlling the EIP

##### locating eip  by creating unique pattern

```
msf-pattern_create -h
msf-pattern_create -l length of buffer

```



##### locating the offset address of eip

```
msf-pattern_offset -h
msf-pattern_offset -l lengthofbuffer -q stringfromeip
```



#### locating space for shell code

##### checking for bad charcters

## data format
load word or store word instruction uses only one memory address. The lowest address of the four bytes is used for the address of a block of four contiguous bytes.

How is a 32-bit pattern held in the four bytes of memory? There are 32 bits in the four bytes and 32 bits in the pattern, but a choice has to be made about which byte of memory gets what part of the pattern. There are two ways that computers commonly do this:

### Big Endian Byte Order: 
   The most significant byte (the "big end") of the data is placed at the byte with the lowest address. The rest of the data is placed in order in the next three bytes in memory.

###  Little Endian Byte Order: 
The least significant byte (the "little end") of the data is placed at the byte with the lowest address. The rest of the data is placed in order in the next three bytes in memory.

In these definitions, the data, a 32-bit pattern, is regarded as a 32-bit unsigned integer. The "most significant" byte is the one for the largest powers of two: 231, ..., 224. The "least significant" byte is the one for the smallest powers of two: 27, ..., 20.


For example, say that the 32-bit pattern 0x12345678 is stored at address 0x00400000. The most significant byte is 0x12; the least significant is 0x78.

Within a byte the order of the bits is the same for all computers (no matter how the bytes themselves are arranged).
